You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note**: Given n will be a positive integer.

Hint: To reach n-th step, what could have been your previous steps? (Think about the step sizes)

Example 1:
```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Solution:
#### Approach 1: Brute Force
In this brute force approach we take all possible step combinations i.e. 1 and 2, at every step. At every step we are calling the function climbStairsclimbStairs for step 11 and 22, and return the sum of returned values of both functions.

`climbStairs(i,n)=(i+1,n)+climbStairs(i+2,n)`

where i defines the current step and n defines the destination step.
